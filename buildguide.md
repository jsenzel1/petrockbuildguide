# welcome to the pet rock build guide! 
this build should be pretty easy and beginner friendly. The one slightly difficult part is soldering the power header - there is an alternative way to solder it which will look a bit worse but leave less room for mishaps. If you have reccomendations for this build guide open an issue or email me at petrockjonah@gmail.com

- The **"front"** of the main pcb (black board) is the part with all the shiny metal bits like the battery cover, and the usb port*

- The **"back"** of the main pcb (black board) is the part with all the moon designs on it - so just remember, moons are on the back

- the **"lens pcb"** is the purple one

- the **panel** is the purple one

_Use no-clean type solder (if you have it)_

## Step 1: Power Header

### (option 1: slightly riskier soldering, prettier connector)
---
The black plastic header base rests on the **back** of the PCB. (note that the pattern for the header is on the front of the PCB, not the back).

The Long pins of the Header pass **through** the PCB. 

you will be soldering on the **front** of the pcb 

Be careful! lots of teeny tiny components here, don't get solder on them or connect them to the main pins - if you do, try to remedy it - if you accidently unseat a component, try and put it back where it was - I've tried my best to keep it clear ish, but as you can see this puppy is crowdeeedddd

Be careful not to get solder on the end of
the long pins, or more than halfway up the pins, to be sure that the purple lens PCB can fit
properly on the header pins.


### (option 2: easier soldering, uglier connector)

The black plastic header base rests on the **front** of the PCB. (where the marking is).

The Long pins of the Header pass **through** the PCB.

you will be soldering on the **back** of the PCB

Be careful not to get solder far up on the end of
the long pins, to be sure that the power cable fits properly on the header pins

## Step 2: Install Lens PCB. 

push the lens pcb down on top of the pins, so that the text is facing you - it will be hard to push down. Solder two or more pins, one at each end of
the connector, to hold it the PCB in place, being careful to not short any pins together (this step is optional - depending on the fit it will most likely be totally fine without solder - and worst case scenario you can just push it back into place or solder later if it happens to become a problem - my daily driver pet rock doesn't have it).

## Step 3: Install pushbutton 
Install pushbutton on **back** of main PCB (note that the pattern for the switch is on the front of
the PCB, not the back).

## Step 4: Install jacks
-Install 4 jacks on **front** of main PCB. After placing the jacks onto the PC board, place the
panel over the four jacks to align them properly on the PCB, and then solder all the pins on
each them while they are properly in place. You can loosely add the jack nuts and place the whole thing upside down if you like

Install 4 pc round jack nuts onto the jacks. Use a tool  to ensure they are tightn(needlenose pliers work well or tweezers in a pinch putting them into the little divets in the nuts), while being
careful not to scratch the panel.

- Install the battery into the battery holder on the main PCB. The positive (wider) side of the
battery faces AWAY from the main PCB. Ensure the battery is pushed all the way into its holder.

- Flash the module! it's super easy - at [update.petrock.site](https://update.petrock.site/)

- Plug the module in and test it out

# DONE BABYYY

- ponder the greatness of life, the joy of electronics, how such a simple process, can lead to an earth shatteringly wonderful device

alternatively become frustrated with technology, try and fail at problem after problem, get solder over all small components, concentrate your raw powerful anger into the seemingly simple process of assembling this eternally fetid module, the wasteland of technilogical hubris overcomes you, channel your rage, burn, eurorack, burn!!
